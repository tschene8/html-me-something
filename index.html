            <h3>Career path from college to present</h3>
        </header>
        <main>
            <p><h4>My first job out of college was an assistant manager at Walgreens.</h4>
            <br>We called ourselves "glorified stockboys".
            <div class="lists">
            <ol>
                <li>We stocked shelves <em>(obviously)</em></li>
                <li>We processed customer returns and exchanges</li>
                <li>We 'supervised' employees who thought they knew more than us...
                    and quite possibly did</li>
            </ol></div>
            <img src="images/Walgreens-store-image.jpg" height="420" width="560">
            <br>It was run of the mill retail management.</p>
            <p><h4>I left Walgreens and took a management position with FedexOffice.</h4>
                <br>There I dove into a world of Kinkos printing combined with Fedex shipping.
                <br>After a couple years I was promoted to store manager at my own location.
                <br><img src="images/fedex office.jpg" height="360" width="360">
                <br>I was working up the ranks, but the print industry was quickly downsizing.</p>
            <p><h4>I found a supply chain position with the Department of Mental Health at Bellefontaine Habiliation Center.</h4>
                <br>I was able to jump right in and do what I'm good at: control inventory, make educated purchasing decisions,
                and save money.</p>
                <p>A few of my duties included:</p>
                <div class="lists">
                <ul>
                    <li>purchasing</li>
                    <li>inventory control</li>
                    <li>asset management</li>
                    <li>supervising the department food court</li>
                </ul></div>
                Unfortunately the position did not pay very much. I had to move on after less than a year.</p>
            <p><h4>A small business called <a href ="http://www.mogoldbuyers.com/">Missouri Gold Buyers</a> recruited me
                    to become one of their store managers.</h4>
                <br>The job was what it sounds like... I bought gold from people who wanted to sell it.
                <br>I was brought in with promises of company growth and all the bells and whistles,
                    within 6 months they closed two-thirds of their stores.
                <br><em>so that didn't work out.</em></p>
            <p><h4>I became a carrier with the United States Postal Service</h4>
                <br>When I took this position 3 years ago I felt like all my education and experience wasn't worth anything.
                <div class="lists">
                <ul>
                    <li>I drive a postal truck</li>
                    <li>I sort endless amounts of mail</li>
                    <li>I deliver mountains of packages</li>
                </ul></div>
                Although my postal duties are quite time consuming, I have always been used to more responsibility.
                    <br>I decided to be the local shop steward at my office, proud member of the NRLCA.
